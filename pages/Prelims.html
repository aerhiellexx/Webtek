    		<p><h4>Head</h4> - identical to get, except that the entity is not included in the response. Also used to retrieve meta info about the entity implied by the request without transferring the entity itself. Like get, it must be supported by all general - pupose servers. </p>
    		<p><h4>Post</h4> - used to request the server accept data entities enclosing in the message body for processing by the response identified by the request uri. Typically used in submitting html form data. </p>
    		<p><h4>Post</h4> - used to request the server to store the enclosed entity in the message body under the specified request uri. </p>
    		<p><h4>Delete</h4> - used to request the server to delete the resource identified by the request uri. </p>
    		<p><h4>Options</h4> - used to request from the server information about the communication options available for the response identified by the required uri. </p>
    		<p><h4>Trace</h4> - used to request the server to echo back to the client the received request. Typically used for testing/diagnostics if the request/response chain. </p>
    		<p><h4>Connect</h4> - reserved for the tunneling proxy servers. </p>
    </div>
<button class="accordion"><h5>HTTP Message Headers</h5></button>
    <div class="panel">
	    <h3>General Header Fields</h3>
	    <p><h4>Cache-control</h4> - Use for collecting and storing valuable data for both request and response and to be used later for realoding a certain file or site. </p>
	    <p><h4>Connection</h4> - Use to control network connection.Example of this is "Keep-Alive" this will keep the connection until you close the browser.    </p>

        <p><h4>Authorization</h4> - Contains the credentials to authenticate a user agent with a server. </p>
        <p><h4>Expect</h4> - Indicates expectations that need to be fulfilled by the server in order to properly handle the request. </p>
        <p><h4>From</h4> - Contains an Internet email address for a human user who controls the requesting user agent. </p>
        <p><h4>Host</h4> - Specifies the domain name of the server (for virtual hosting), and the TCP port number on which the server is listening. </p>

        <p><h4>If-modified-since</h4> - Makes the request conditional and expects the entity to be transmitted only if it has been modified after the given date. </p>
        <p><h4>If-none-match</h4> - Makes the request conditional and applies the method only if the stored resource doesn't match any of the given ETags. This is used to update caches (for safe requests), or to prevent to upload a new resource when one is already existing. </p>
	<p><h4>If-Range</h4> - Is a special condition request that is similar to If-match and If-Unmodified-Since but it ignores the range of header field if the specific range did not match resulting to a 412 error.</p>
	<p><h4>If-Unmodified-since</h4> - Makes the request is conditional on the last modified date early than or equl to the date provided. </p>
	<p><h4>Max-Forward</h4> - Method to limit the number of a proxies that can forward to the server. It is also associated with Trace and Option.</p>

	<p><h4>Range</h4> - Allows user to set a specific range of HTTP message / document from the client. </p>
	<p><h4>Referer</h4> - Allows a server to generate a list of link to the resources for logging and caching. </p>
	<p><h4>User-Agent</h4> - A header field contains where a user agent request came from.</p>

	<h3>Respone Header fields</h3>
	<p><h4>Accept-Ranges</h4> - Allows the server to indicate it's acceptance of range on the resource.</p>

    		HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It describes and defines the content of a webpage. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a webpage's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality (JavaScript). 

    		<br>

			"HyperText" refers to links that connect webpages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

			<br> 

			HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as &lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, and many others.

            <h5>HTML History</h5>
        </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            The founder of HTML was Tim Berners-Lee and his product was made attractive to the general public by Mosaic browser which was evolved at NCSA. It has become extremely popular and well-known in the 1990’s when the Internet had been developing rapidly. During this period, HTML was broadened and presented in different modifications. The Internet strongly depends on vendors and page creators who share the joint conventions for HTML. The understanding that success of Web development is based on integration of the rules has helped the Web community to create united specifications for HTML. 

            <br>
                    
            Most users and developers understand that HTML documents must work in the same way on different platforms and browsers. Compatibility of HTML is its key benefit and it saves time for developers who don’t have to create several versions of a document for different users. Otherwise the Internet wouldn’t be able to be so easy-to-access and the ‘battle of formats’ would be a serious obstacle for the Web evolution. 

            <br>

            The vision of the HTML developers is that all devices must be able to reach the data on the Internet: computers with different platforms, browsers and characteristics, pocket devices, cell phones, devices for speech, and many others.
